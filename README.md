AI-Powered Accessible Route Planning for Individuals with Special Needs

üìú Project Overview

This project presents an advanced computational system designed to solve a critical real-world problem: finding the safest and most efficient travel routes for specially-abled individuals. Standard navigation tools often fail to consider accessibility barriers, such as stairs, rough terrain, or unsafe crossings. This work leverages Artificial Intelligence search algorithms and Fuzzy Logic to create a context-aware pathfinding solution.

The notebook demonstrates a sophisticated application of AI intelligence by building a system from the ground up. It defines custom maps, path costs, and intelligent heuristics tailored to the unique needs of users with mobility challenges, showcasing a deep expertise in both algorithm design and practical problem-solving.


üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms and Intelligent Systems
This project moves beyond standard implementations by creating a nuanced, intelligent navigation framework.

Core Framework: A flexible object-oriented design using Problem and Node classes allows the system to be adapted to various maps and user needs.

Informed Search: The A* Search algorithm is the cornerstone of the pathfinding logic, chosen for its efficiency in finding the optimal path by using intelligent estimates (heuristics).

Custom Heuristics for Accessibility: The true innovation lies in the design of the heuristic function. Instead of simple distance, the heuristics incorporate a multi-faceted cost system, penalizing paths with:

Stairs and steep inclines.

Uneven or difficult terrain.

High traffic or unsafe road crossings.

Poor lighting or lack of pedestrian infrastructure.


Fuzzy Logic Integration: To handle the inherent ambiguity of real-world conditions, the system incorporates Fuzzy Logic. This allows the model to interpret vague concepts like "slightly crowded," "moderately steep," or "poorly lit." Instead of binary costs (e.g., safe/unsafe), Fuzzy Logic enables the system to calculate a nuanced "accessibility score" for each path segment, leading to more realistic and human-like decision-making.


üí° Conclusion & Expertise Demonstrated
This project successfully develops a proof-of-concept for an intelligent and empathetic navigation system. It demonstrates a strong command of computational AI by not only implementing complex algorithms like A* but by customizing them with sophisticated, real-world heuristics. The integration of Fuzzy Logic showcases an advanced understanding of how to model and solve problems with uncertain or imprecise data. The result is a powerful tool that prioritizes safety and accessibility, offering a significant improvement over traditional pathfinding solutions.
